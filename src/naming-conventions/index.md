# Introduction

Personally, I find naming quite hard in general. It is easy to smash
the keyboard and let fate construct a name but, as with
[case styles](/case-styles/), not giving thought to this can cause
headaches when reading codes.

Not only do you need to find the right words to make your variables
descriptive, they also need to be concise. When you reuse a concept
over and over in your code, at some point, you'll run out of ways to
convey the same thing in a unique way.
