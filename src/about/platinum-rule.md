# Platinum Rule

I don't believe that there are *best practices* in software
development. It is still a fairly young field. Things are constantly
changing. Even the established standards are always being challenged
for a better method. If there does exist a *true* best practices list
that everyone agree on, the items would be rather vague and general.


However, there is **one** practice that I think is the most valuable of
all that exists around despite being vague and general. And that is to
> Be Consistent

It may seem contradictory to the ever-changing landscape I just
described, and may also sound hypocritical of me to say that after
mentioning that I change my ways quite often in my introduction. It is
a practice I fail to follow most of the time, I admit. Still, it would
be the biggest, and likely only, advice I would give anyone.

At the very least, keep the programming styles and decisions consistent
across a single project. Whatever those are. Even if you know you will
hate them later on.

Why `Platinum Rule`? Well, because `Golden Rule` is taken.
