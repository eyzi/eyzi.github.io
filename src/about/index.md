# Introduction

Hi, my name is Eyzi and I am a programmer by trade.

I thought I'd use this space as a place where I layout or explain my
coding practices and philosophies. I won't claim to be an expert in
programming, but I would be happy to share the little that I do know.

I mainly code in JavaScript and so my examples will mostly be in that
language but I'll try to make them as generic as I can. This site will
also be updated regularly so if you see a section that has changed,
that's just because _my_ practice or philosophy has changed. I do that
a lot.

If you'd like to reach me, you can do so by email
at [contact@eyzi.dev](mailto:contact@eyzi.dev) or on Discord at

By the way, this site is powered by
[Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)!
