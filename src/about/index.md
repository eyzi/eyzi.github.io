# Introduction

Hi, my name is Eyzi and I am a bored software developer.

I figured I'd use this space to lay out the programming practices and
philosophies that I follow or have developed over the years. As well as
document how and why I would decide to change my mind of some of these,
which is very likely.

I want to lay it out as a sort of programming tutorial to hopefully be
of value to those who are trying to get into programming. I may use
language-specific snippets but I want to keep the concepts abstract and
applicable to any programming language as much as I can.

If you'd like to reach me, you can do so by email
at [contact@eyzi.dev](mailto:contact@eyzi.dev) or tweet at me
