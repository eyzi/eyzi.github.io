# Introduction

Hi, my name is Eyzi and I am a software developer.

I figure I'd use this space to lay out the programming practices and
philosophies that I follow or have developed over the years. As well as
document how and why I would decide to change my mind of some of these,
which is very likely. It would be interesting to see how I change my
ways as years pass by. Equally as interesting to see which ones would
stand the test of time.

If you'd like to reach me, you can do so by email
at [contact@eyzi.dev](mailto:contact@eyzi.dev) or tweet at me

As an aside, there is a [community-built best practices
repository](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices) which
has the same idea as this space but a lot more extensive. It is
specific to NodeJS, but some concepts are language agnostic.

By the way, this site is powered by
[Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)!
