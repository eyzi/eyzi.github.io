# What is programming?

Programming. Coding. Developing.

Most of the time, it doesn't matter what you call it. These words are
often used interchangeably. I do like using `programming` more of the
three as I think it captures the essence of it best.

So what is it?

Simply put, programming is instructing a computer to do a task.

You may rephrase this to "telling a computer *what* to do", or "telling
a computer *how* to do something". Both are valid *paradigms* of
programming.

Have you ever used a cookbook? A recipe lists the ingredients we need,
and also lists the steps we need to do. Followed diligently, we will be
able to transform the ingredients into the dish that the recipe is
for.

Programming is much like writing a recipe that the computer
understands, with the dish being the outcome that we want. Only, in
programming, the computer is very diligent in following instructions.
Maybe even too diligent.

That may sound simple, but the fact that the computer will always do
what you *tell* it to do means that if it's not doing what we *want* it
to do, then the fault is likely our own. This is the cause of a lot of
headaches in programming.
