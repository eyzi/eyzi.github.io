# Where should I program?

The beauty of programming is that as long as you have anything that
resembles a computer, you can program in it.

But that's sort of a cop out answer. A more realistic one is to find
an code editor, also known as an IDE, that supports most, if not all,
your programming needs. VS Code is the de facto standard for IDEs
today.

If you're not keen on installing unfamiliar programs to your computer,
you can start with some online code editors and compilers. You computer
does not need to be state of the art to run a program.
