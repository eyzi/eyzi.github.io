# Introduction

Problem solving is such a core, not only in software development, but
also in general daily life. We are constantly solving problems that we
may not realize. Software development only makes it apparent as it
offers a new set of technique in addressing problems.

In fact, in all areas of software development, problem solving is the
skill I personally want to improve the most.

## How to define a problem

> The first step of solving any problem is recognizing that there is
one

When your arms hurt, your doctor would not recommend amputation as the
first choice.

Defining a problem may sound simple, but it is vital to ensuring that
the solution we get does solve the actual problem. If we are not
specific enough, we may come to a solution that only partly solves it,
if at all.

## How to devise a solution

## Thinking outside the box

Contrary to what most people may think, I believe solving a problem
needs to not be serious, or at least be allowed a significant portion
of the problem solving process -- maybe about half -- to play around
with absurd ideas. This allows for the mind to not tunnel vision onto
a few parameters of the problems that you would otherwise think are
necessary to solving it, and allow your mind to take a step back and
look at the problem in one or more different perspectives. After all,
the serious and focused part is only required when implementing the
solution to the problem.

## Evaluating a programmer

A test may show how good a programmer is on a particular language or
particular subject, but I believe there is no test that accurately
gauges how good a programmer is at solving problems, which I would say
is what makes a good programmer. Observing how someone learns or adapts
to challenges could be a better tell of good problem solving skills,
which would take more time than doing a test.

- Working - "Does this solve the problem?"
- Correct - "Is this the right solution to the problem"
- Succint - "Are there any unnecessary parts of this solution?"
