# UPPERCASE

We come to the first case style that is useful when disagreeing with
someone on the internet, and also when coding. It is when every letter
of the word is capitalize to put emphasis on how loud you want to get
your point across.

Anytime you see a WORD in all-caps, it just give a sense of importance,
doesn't it? Like it's begging to be seen. Like it's firm on what it
stands for. We just instinctively associate feel it.

```js
// TODO: Stop procrastinating
```

We can also use it for words that hold a single value or to mean one
thing and one thing only.

```js
PI = 3.14159265359;
```

```txt
INFO: ...
WARNING: ...
ERROR: ...
```
