# dotted.case

Using dot (`.`) as a separator is probably the least common of all of
these. A common place you'll see this is likely when working with JSON
objects.

```
message.author.name
```

Another place I've seen it used is in feature toggles, which is quite
smart as it resembles accessing a JSON object property.

```
api.users.showPassword
```
