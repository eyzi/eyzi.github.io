# Sentence case

The sentence case may be the most common case we see around. After all,
it is the default case that people in most countries write or type in.
It is the very case you see as you read this sentence. The rules of the
language you're writing in apply to this style. A common rule is that
the first letter of the first word is capitalized and the rest are
often not.

In code, we often see this in comments, README files, and anything that
is intented to be read by a human.
