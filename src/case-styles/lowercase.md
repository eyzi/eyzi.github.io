# lowercase

Now we come to a style that totally tosses the idea of capitalization
out of the window. While capitalization is about emphasis, the
lowercase style benefits from the lack of it. That is, it makes the
words--or the meaning of the words--neutral, it doesn't catch the eye
too much, and often it's smoother to read.

Keywords in (modern) programming languages are often in lowercase.
Firstly, since you don't have to worry about capitalization, it makes
them easier to remember.

```js
export default {};
```

As with the [uppercase style](/case-styles/uppercase), it makes it
easier to evaluate text as you don't have to worry about
capitalization. When texts are involved, you'll often see code that
converts them to either lowercase or uppercase before being evaluated.

```js
switch (currency.toLowerCase()) {
  case "usd": ...;
  case "cad": ...;
  case "gbp": ...;
  case "jpy": ...;
}
```
