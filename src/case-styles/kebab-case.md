# kebab-case

The dash (`-`) can also be used as a separator. If you have ever
inspected the elements of any website, you probably have seen the kebab
case used. Usually in attributes, like `id` and `class`.

```html
<span id="kebab-case" class="padding-10">Kebab Case</span>
```

I also like using the kebab case in file and directory names. I just
find it a bit easier to read as kebab case, especially when directory
routing comes into play.

A file path just flows nicely with dashes, I think.

```
lib/misc-data/supported-file-types.json
```

Case in point, the URL of this page:
