# kebab-case

The dash (`-`) can also be used as a separator. If you have ever
inspected the elements of any websites, you probably have seen the
kebab case used. Usually in attributes, like `id` and `class`.

```html
<span id="kebab-case" class="padding-10">Kebab Case</span>
```

I also like using the kebab case in file and directory names. While
using other styles like [camel case](/case-styles/camel-case) or
[snake case](/case-styles/snake-case) for file names is perfectly
acceptable, I find it a bit easier to read as kebab case, especially
when directory routing comes into play.

Case in point, the URL of this page:
