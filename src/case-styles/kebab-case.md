# kebab-case

The dash (`-`) can also be used as a separator. If you have ever
inspected the elements of any websites, you probably have seen the
kebab case used. Usually in attributes, like `id` and `class`.

```html
<span id="kebab-case" class="padding-10">Kebab Case</span>
```

> <span style="font-weight:600;color:#c23030;">Warning:</span> Opinions
> ahead

There is another place I use this style a lot--which I feel a lot of
programmers would disagree--and that is filenames. Take a look at the
following examples.

```
caseStyles.txt
```

```
case_styles.txt
```

```
case-styles.txt
```

Anyone can argue how any one of them is better than anything else, and
they would be right. Personally, I would use kebab case.

Here's my thought behind it. Case sensitivity can be an issue with
filenames so [camel case](/case-styles/camel-case) would not be a very
good option. I don't have a good argument against using
[snake case](/case-styles/snake-case) other than that the underscore
just takes more space visually than a dash.

Case in point, check the url of this page.

Doesn't it just look natural when applied to directory routing?

Objections? I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on this!
