# Title Case

Like the [sentence case](/case-styles/sentence-case), the title case is
a style that is intended for humans to read. It is mostly used in
titles, in case that isn't obvious yet. In this style, the first
letter of every word is capitalized to emphasize the importance of the
group of words as a whole.
