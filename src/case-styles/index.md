# Introduction

Before thinking about the concepts in programming, I think it is vital
that we understand the styles in which we write. After all, we will be
_writing_ code. With that, we will also be _reading_ code. A lot.

Case styles are how we construct text. It is a tool we can (and have)
to use so we convey the right message across.

## Capitalization

A recurring concept is capitalization. In general, capitalized letters
are bigger and so they are more eye-catching. It makes a word (or part
of it) seem important. This is often used for emphasis.

## Separators

We need a means of separating words. The most common one being a space.
When a space has a defined meaning and we need another way to separate
our words, we can also use all sorts of non-alphanumeric values as
separators, such as symbols.

## Consistency

As mentioned in the [Platinum Rule](/about/platinum-rule) section,
being consistency is important. This is especially true with case
styles.

As programmers, we spend more time reading code that writing it. You
will be reading someone else's code. Someone else will be reading your
code. Hell, you will be reading your own code! The best thing we can do
is make reading less of a chore, and being consistent when we use what
kind of case style helps achieve that.
