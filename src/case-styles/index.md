# What are Case Styles?

Case styles are how we construct text. It is a tool we can (and have)
to use so we convey the right message across. These styles bring rhythm
to our prose. The more consistent our usage is, the easier it is for
others to understand us.

This is especially important to keep in mind while programming. Not
only do we need to write in a way that a machine could understand, but
also for other people to understand. You never know when someone will
have to read the code we write, including our future selves.

Being consistent with how and when we use these styles is the most
important thing in programming. The second most important thing is
having good shared knowledge among the people who you work with and
will work with. That is where following conventions and good practices
come in handy as it is something you can expect everyone already know.
Otherwise, you better make sure your documentation skills are damn
good.

## Capitalization

A recurring concept is capitalization. In general, capitalized letters
are bigger and so they are more eye-catching. It makes a word (or part
of it) seem important. This is used for emphasis.

## Separators

We need a means of separating words. The most common one being a space.
When a space has a defined meaning and we need another way to separate
our words, we can also use all sorts of non-alphanumeric values as
separators, such as symbols.
