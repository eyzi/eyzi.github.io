# justMix\_\_ALL--Styles

This may look like an abomination, but there are rare instances when
using mixed case styles has a use case (pun intended). Though, you can
probably guess that it is strongly recommended **NOT** to use it if you
can help it.

One relatively popular application is [BEM](http://getbem.com/). Often
used in HTML classes to distinguish between block, element, and
modifier.

```html
<input class="form__input--disabled" />
```
