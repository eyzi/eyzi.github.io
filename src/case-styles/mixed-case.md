# justMix\_\_ALL--Styles

This may look like an abomination, but using mixed case styles is
actually quite common. Though, you can probably guess that it is
strongly recommended **NOT** to use it if you can help it.

It can be useful for certain things, like when there are multiple
things in a statement that you need to group together to make its
meaning more apparent. One relatively popular application is
[BEM](http://getbem.com/). Often used in CSS classes to distinguish
between block, element, and modifier.

```html
<input class="form__input--disabled" />
```
