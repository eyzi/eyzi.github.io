# camelCase

The most ubiquitous case style in the world of programming is the
camel case.

Imagine this. You are writing in lowercase and you have to type a group
of words as a single keyword. You can't use space as it is used to
separate keywords. You also can't use symbols. What do you do?

Here's an idea: What if you use capitalization, not as emphasis as it
is usually used for, but as word separator.

```txt
justLikeThis
```

Problem solved.

Since programmers are often bound to the same constraints mentioned
above, especially when naming variables and function names, it's easy
to imagine why programmers use it a lot, especially for variables and
function names.

```js
function calculateAreaOfCircle(radius) { ... }
```

## PascalCase

A variation of the camel case except the first letter is also
capitalized. It sort of has the same effect as the
[title case](/case-styles/title-case). As such, it is used when the
keyword needs to be distinct from the usual variable name, such as
a class name.

In programming languages like C#, it is a convention to use pascal case
for variables in general. Consult your local tech lead to know when you
should be using pascal case.
