# Introduction

This section deals with how we organize business logic, project
directories, technical roles, and many more. My philosophies on
monolithic services, microservices, monorepositories, etc, and when
to choose which.

# Keep It Simple

A general rule of thumb, stick to what is simple. No need to complicate
anything if it doesn't call for it.
